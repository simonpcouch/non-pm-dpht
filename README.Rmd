## Power Analyses of Differentially Private Nonparametric Hypothesis Tests

This repository contains source code to carry out the power analyses of several differentially private hypothesis testing algorithms from the 2019 paper *Differentially Private Nonparametric Hypothesis Testing* [1].

The following conventions have been maintained throughout the repository in order to help the reader follow along.

* Source code is divided up by hypothesis test.
    + `anova` refers to our implementation of Swanberg et. al.'s differentially private ANOVA test [2], developed for the 3 or more group parametric setting.
    + `kw` refers to our tests developed for the 3 or more group nonparametric setting, analogous to the public Kruskal-Wallis test.
    + `mw` refers to our tests developed for the 2 group, unpaired nonparametric setting, analogous to the public Mann-Whitney test.
    + `t` refers to our tests developed for the 2 group, paired parametric setting, analogous to the public paired t-test.
    + `wc` refers to our tests developed for the 2 group, paired nonparametric setting, analogous to the public Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test (as well as our implementation of Task and Clifton's test [3].)
* The test subfolders generally follow the same organization. 
    + In each, there is a `data` subsubfolder containing datasets resulting from the simulations and analyses. 
    + In some, too, there is a `fxns` subsubfolder--this folder contains functions that are sourced throughout the repository. In particular, two appear many times. `gen_data` simulates many trials worth of sample data with given parameters, and `calc_stat` takes in a dataframe outputted by `gen_data` and outputs a distribution of test statistics. These two functions can be mapped over various parameterizations (this wrapping is usually referred to as `pwr_plot`) to generate a reference distribution, calculate critical values, generate an alternate distribution, and calculate power. Note that several `gen_data`s, `calc_stat`s, and `pwr_plot`s exist for different tests throughout this repositoryâ€”the hope is that this consistency invokes the fact that these functions serve the same purpose in different settings, even though they are named redundantly.
    + With a few exceptions, `.Rmd` files contain implementations of the full `gen_data`-`calc_stat` framework in order to conduct power analyses of our tests. These files generally contain the code to be used for a subset of the plots needed, and one can pick up on naming conventions after spending a short time with the file structure.
* All figures (exclusively saved to the `figures` folder) and dataframes are saved with the prefix(es) denoting the relevant tests. Dataframe objects are always stored under the same name as the file they are saved to. When there is an explicit pairing between a plot and a dataframe, they are given the same name.
* On several occasions, we make comparisons between tests. In these cases, when possible, we consolidate code for plots in the folder of whichever test came first in the order presented in the paper (Kruskal Wallis, ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon, Paired-t.) However, note that all comparisons to ANOVA happen in the `anova` folder.
* All files paths are written such that the document can be executed with the parent folder as the working directory.

Note that these files are slightly modified versions of the original ones used to conduct the power analyses in order to make this repository more easily navigable to readers. Comments have been added, files have been given more informative names, and file structure has been simplified. I've done my best to ensure that file sourcing and saving still operates as intended, but if I missed something, feel free to open an issue and let me know.

Please note, too, that calls to `pwr_plot` *should* take a significant amount of time to run. To reduce running time (being aware that this will result in less precise plotting points), the `reps` argument can be decreased.
